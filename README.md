# BGH Client [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JasonYang96/bgh-client.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JasonYang96/bgh-client)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.4.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

1. You will need Node & NPM (I prefer to use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/))

`$ brew install node`

2. You will also need [angular cli](https://cli.angular.io/)

`$ npm install -g @angular/cli`

### Installing Dependencies

`$ npm install`

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Running tests

#### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

#### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
